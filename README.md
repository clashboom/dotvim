# bling.vim

A highly tuned vim distribution that will blow your socks off!

## introduction

this is my ***personal*** vim distribution that i have tweaked over time and evolved from a simple vanilla vimrc configuration to a full-blown distribution that it is today.

while it is very easy to install this and get up and running on a brand new machine (a use case i have), i recommend that you do not install this unless you fully understand everything that's going on inside.  scan it for tips and tricks, or fork and customize it for *your* needs.

## installation

1.  clone this repository into your `~/.vim` directory
1.  `git submodule init && git submodule update`
1.  `mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.backup`
1.  create the following shim and save it as `~/.vimrc`:

```
let g:dotvim_settings = {}
let g:dotvim_settings.version = 1
source ~/.vim/vimrc
```

1.  startup vim and neobundle will detect and ask you install any missing plugins.  you can also manually initiate this with `:NeoBundleInstall`
1.  done!

### versioning

the `g:dotvim_settings.version` is a simple version number which is manually edited.  it is used to detect whether significant breaking changes have been introduced so that users of the distribution can be notified accordingly.

## customization

*  since the distribution is just one file, customization is straightforward.  any customizations can be added to the `g:dotvim_settings` variable, which will be used whilst sourcing the distribution's `vimrc` file.  here is an example:

```
" this is the bare minimum
let g:dotvim_settings = {}
let g:dotvim_settings.version = 1

" here are some basic customizations, please refer to the top of the vimrc file for all possible options
let g:dotvim_settings.default_indent = 3
let g:dotvim_settings.max_column = 80
let g:dotvim_settings.colorscheme = 'my_awesome_colorscheme'

" by default, language specific plugins are not loaded.  this can be changed with the following:
let g:dotvim_settings.plugin_groups_exclude = ['ruby','python']

" if there are groups you want always loaded, you can use this:
let g:dotvim_settings.plugin_groups_include = ['go']

" alternatively, you can set this variable to load exactly what you want
let g:dotvim_settings.plugin_groups = ['core','web']

" if there is a particular plugin you don't like, you can define this variable to disable them entirely
let g:dotvim_settings.disabled_plugins=['vim-foo','vim-bar']

" finally, load the distribution
source ~/.vim/vimrc

" anything defined here are simply overrides
set wildignore+=\*/node_modules/\*
set guifont=Wingdings:h10
```

## autocomplete

this distribution will pick one of three combinations, in the following priority:

1.  [neocomplete][nc] + [neosnippet][ns] if you have `lua` enabled.
2.  [youcompleteme][ycm] + [ultisnips][us] if you have compiled YCM.
3.  [neocomplcache][ncl] + [neosnippet][ns] if you only have vimscript available

this can be overridden with `g:dotvim_settings.autocomplete_method`

## standard modifications

*  if you have either [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) or [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) installed, they will be used for `grepprg`
*  all temporary files are stored in `~/.vim/.cache`, such as backup files and persistent undo

* Check out how multiple cursors work, get used to them
* Check out sneak, try it.
* Try out easygrep
* For instant markdown - [sudo] gem install pygments.rb [sudo] gem install redcarpet -v 2.3.0 [sudo] npm -g install instant-markdown-d If you're on Linux, the xdg-utils package needs to be installed
